### Description:

As part of a collaborative project involving four software engineering students, I focused on developing the backend to support the Questions & Answers component of the frontend retail web portal.

- **Overview**: Manages requests related to product details, styles, and cart operations.
- **Ratings & Reviews**: Handles data for customer reviews, including submission and retrieval.
- **Questions & Answers**: Facilitates the Q&A section, allowing customers to ask and answer product-related questions.
- **Related Items & Comparison**: Supports retrieving data for related products and customer-built outfits.

### Performance-Enhancements

**Optimization Techniques**:

- Improved read times for questions and answers using MongoDB's aggregation pipeline, indexing, limits, and field projections.

**New Relic Monitoring**:

- Utilized New Relic for real-time performance monitoring, achieving significant improvements in response times and throughput.
- GET Questions: Response time reduced by 100%.
- GET Answers: Response time reduced by over 200%.
- Mark Question/Answer Helpful and Report Question/Answer times reduced by 75%.

**Loader.io Testing and Load Balancing with NGINX**:

- Increased RPS from 1000 to 2700 using load balancing and caching with Nginx while maintaining latency < 50ms and 0% error rate

### Further Improvements:

- try different implementations of caching
